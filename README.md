### Project Description
MoneyMap is a web-based platform designed to help users manage their finances effectively. The application allows users to track their expenses across various categories, such as bills, transportation, food, health, and more. By categorizing and summing up expenses, users can visualize their spending patterns, stay within their budget limits, and gain insights into their financial habits.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
MoneyMap is solving the tragic problem of people not knowing where their money is going â€” and preventing them from being caught off-guard when they suddenly realize they've spent all their savings on takeout, coffee, and impulse Amazon buys! Itâ€™s like being your personal financial detective, without having to hire one.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
MoneyMap is a simple, user-friendly platform that helps you track and manage your expenses in real-time. It categorizes your spending (e.g., bills, food, transportation), totals your expenses, and alerts you if you exceed your budget. The goal is to make managing finances easy, clear, and stress-free.
